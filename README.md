## 🧠 About Me

I'm a technically curious and self-driven engineering student at **MNNIT Allahabad**, with hands-on experience across **software development, embedded systems, AI-assisted platforms, and interactive simulations**.

My work spans from developing **full-stack web platforms** and **intelligent automation tools** to creating **logic-intensive solutions** using **C++, Java, and Python**. I'm passionate about building **developer-first systems** that are fast, scalable, and intelligent.

Currently, I'm focused on:
- Developing a **MERN-based AI-powered team collaboration platform**
- Exploring **real-time multiplayer logic and physics systems** using **Unity**
- Practicing **competitive programming** and system design with C++/Java
- Creating **simulation models** in **MATLAB** for signal processing & ECE concepts
